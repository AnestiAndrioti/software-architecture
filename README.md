"# software-architecture" 

This is Phase 1. 
The tests are working with a small hack of using pointers. For the next phase I need to work on designing a solution that works without the need of pointers. 
I am also planning on redesigning the architecture and add class that handles the type of the objects. 
By doing so, adding some constructors for the operations will permit type checking at compile time instead of run time. 
All of these will be resolved by phase 2 if possible otherwise these changes will be included in phase 3.
